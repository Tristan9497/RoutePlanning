# RoutePlanning
This Package is supposed to be the base for the autonomous navigation of our robot in a road like environment. Some of the used Packages wont be found in this repository since i don't have permission to share them.

The Robot is supposed to follow a road on the correct lanes and dodge upcoming obstacles as needed. At the same time it is maping the surounding area and is localizing itself in the map.

This work will be done during my bachelor thesis and hopefully will be improved and used by other people in the future
