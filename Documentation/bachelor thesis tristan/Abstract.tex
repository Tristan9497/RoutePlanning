This bachelor thesis is about the concept, setup/development and testing of a software stack used for the autonomous navigation in an environment defined by the rules of the carolo cup.\\

 The aim of this stack is lane following and obstacle avoidance based on a sensor data of the environment. This thesis extends the work of Prof. HÃ¶rmann who provided the road detection and is supposed to be used by the carolo cup team of university aalen in the future. Even though the robot used in this thesis does not satisfy the rules of the carolo cup the stack should be configurable for different robots aswell.\\

The robot is equipped with a lidar, a camera, wheel encoders and an imu. The data of these sensors will be filtered and processed using existent ros packages as well as newly developed ones. The resulting data will be fed into the navigation stack that then determines the best route for the robot.\\

Since there wasn't a driving robot available at the start of this thesis the task of simulating the robot with all of its sensor data and actors has been incorporated into the subject of this work.
